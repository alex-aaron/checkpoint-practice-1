### Week 1 Checkpoint Practice

Complete the prompts below.

#### Problem 1
Create a function called `createNumberedList` that takes in one parameter - `array` - which represents an array of todo items as strings. Assume, this input array will ALWAYS have 3 items. This function should create a numbered list WITH LINEBREAKS from this array.

*Hint*: Look up the line break character `\n` to properly format the string.

```
var todos = ['feed cat', 'do laundry', 'do dishes'];

createNumberedList(todos);
// RETURNS =>
1. feed cat
2. do laundry
3. do dishes
```
